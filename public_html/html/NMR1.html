        <div><h1>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</h1>
            The nuclei of atoms have property called spin. If the spin is not zero, then it can be modified, flipped over
            to a higher energy state using energy in the presence of a magnetic field. 
            When the nuclei return to their normal state energy is given out. 
            The amount of energy taken in, and therefore given out, depends on the surroundings the atom 
            finds itself in. 
            <ol><b>The amount of energy depends on</b>
                <li>the other atoms connected to the atom</li>
                <li>the amount of electronic charge
            near the atom</li>
                <li>other atoms that are close but not connected to the atom</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Carbon 13 NMR</h2>
            One in every 100 carbon atoms is isotope 13. This isotope gives an NMR spectrum.
            Peaks appear entirely based on the elements connected to the atom. 
            There is one peak in the spectrum for each carbon environment.
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            Methane<br>
            One carbon atom, attached to 3 hydrogens. One carbon environment. One peak 
            in the spectrum.<br>
            Ethane<br>
            Two Carbon atoms. Each attached to 3 hydrogens and 1 carbon. One carbon environment.
            One peak in the spectrum.
            <br>
            Propane<br>
            Three carbon atoms. Two with 3 hydrogens and 1 carbon attached. One with 2 hydrogens and 2 carbons 
            attached. Two carbon environments. Two peaks in the spectrum (very close together)<br>

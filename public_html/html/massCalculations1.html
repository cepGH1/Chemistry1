        <div><h2>Steps to follow</h2>
            <ol><li>Write a word equation</li>
                <li>Write a balanced formula equation</li>
                <li>calculate the Relative Formula Mass of the 
                    reactants and products</li>
                <li>multiply each RFM by the number of that molecule used 
                    by the balanced equation 
                    (ie by the big number in front of it) </li>
                <li>write g after each relative mass to convert them to masses</li>
                <li>work out how to convert the number you have for the
                molecule to the amount of it stated in the question</li>
                <li>Do the same conversion to each of the other relative masses</li>
                <li>Select the amount asked for in the question to report </li>

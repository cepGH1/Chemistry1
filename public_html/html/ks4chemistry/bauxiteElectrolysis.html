            <div>
                <p>Reactive metals cannot be displaced from their oxides using Carbon
                or Carbon Monoxide because they are above Carbon in the reactivity series</p>
                <p>The metals can be extracted by passing electric current through their salts
                after first melting the salts. Remember salts are made up of charged ions.
                They have a infinite lattice structure in the solid state and the ions cannot move
                Once melted, though, the ions can move about. The ions are attracted to places
                that have opposite charge to their own. Here, at the electrodes, they either 
                gain or loose electrons and are turned back into elements. </p>

                Graphite anode and Iron cathode.<br>
                Chlorine gas is the other product from the Downs Cell<br>

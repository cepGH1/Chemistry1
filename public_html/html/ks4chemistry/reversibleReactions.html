            <div>Some special reactions can happen in both directions<br>
                The products of the reaction can react together to remake the reactants<br>
                Two reactions happen at the same time<br>
                Reactants &#8594; Products<br>
                and<br>
                Products &#8594; Reactants<br>
                or<br>
                Reactants &larr; Products<br>
                There is a special sign instead of an arrow that we use to show that a reaction
                is happening in both forwards and reverse direction at the same time

                <h4>Equilibrium</h4>
                The reactions reach a point where the forward and backward reaction are happening 
                at the same rate. This is called equilibrium. At equilibrium there will be a constant
                amount of reactants and a constant amount of products in the reaction mixture.<br>
                When conditions change the rates of the reactions may change and the amounts 
                of reactants and products in the reactions mixture may change. the equlibrium is then
                said to have changed position. The way the equilibrium position changes is predicted
                using <a href="leChateliersPrinciple.html">Le Chatelier's Principle</a>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>2N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) &#8652; 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g) </p>
                Nitrogen and Hydrogen are reacting to form Ammonia. At the same time, 
                Ammonia is decomposing to form Hydrogen and Nitrogen.<br>

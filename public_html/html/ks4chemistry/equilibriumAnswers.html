                    A reversible reaction is one in which the products can react together to recreate
                    the reactants. The two reactions, forwards to make products, and backwards to make 
                    reactants happen at the same time in the reaction mixture. When
                    the forward and backward rate are the same the reaction is at equilibrium.

                    When the forward and backward rates of reaction of a reversible reaction are the same,
                    there are constant amounts of reactants and products in the reaction mixture. The
                    reaction is at equilibrium.

                    Enthalpy of reaction. The amount of energy given out, or takin in, when a reaction occurs
                    is measured in KiloJoules per Mole (KJ/Mol).

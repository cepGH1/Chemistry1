                Metals located in the transition are not so reactive as the group 1 and 2 metals.
                Mostly they are dense metals. Most are hard, but there are exceptions, Mercury and Gold.
                Many of these elements have been in use as metals since ancient times.<br>
                Many of the transition metals have coloured ions.They make coloured compounds.<br>
                Often they can have more than one type of ion (multiple oxidation states).<br>
                Some transition metals are useful as <a id="definitions" onclick="definitionPopUp('./definitions/catalystDefinition.html')">catalysts</a>. 
                For example, the iron catalyst used in

                <p>Hydrogen Fluoride is a gas at room temperature, just. It's boiling
                point is 19.5 degrees centigrade. Just like water it has a high boiling 
                point because there are hydrogen bonds between the molecules.

                    HF is an acid. HF reacts with glass. HF is risky to work with
                    as it causes burns and reacts with bones, displacing the calcium
                    from them and leaving them jelly like.

                    HF is used in industries that require glass and silicon to be 
                    chemically modified.

                    HF is a covalently bonded diatomic molecule.

                The reaction of Iron, with Oxygen and water, to form iron oxides is called rusting
            </div>
            <div>
                Rusting weakens objects made from iron, because iron oxide (rust)
                is powdery and very weak. Iron structures and objects need to be
                protected from rusting
            </div>
            <div>
                Rusting can be prevented in several ways
                <ol>
                    <li>Don't let oxygen contact the iron. Coat the iron with oil
                    so the oxygen cant touch the iron</li>
                    <li>Use a more reactive metal to react with the oxygen before 
                    it gets to the iron. Ingots of magnesium are attached to iron 
                    hulls of ships for this reason</li>
                    <li>Don't allow water to have contact with the iron</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

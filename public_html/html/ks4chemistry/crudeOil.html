                Crude oil is a mixture of organic compounds, mostly hydrocarbons.
                Mined from the ground from oil wells or fracking.

                <h4>Creation</h4>
                Crude oil was created, millions of years ago, by incomplete rotting of small marine animals
                and plants.
                Their bodies got covered by layers of sand and mud. The bodies broke down in the absence oxygen.
                With time, heat and pressure the substance turned into oil and gas.

                <h4>Uses</h4>
                Hydrocarbons react with oxygen. They are fuels. They burn. These reactions release
                lots of energy. We use this energy for many things. <br>
                The hydrocarbons in crude oil are also used to make other useful chemicals.
                They are feedstock for the petrochemical industry

                <h4>Limited Resource</h4>
                Oil takes millions of years to be created, but is used very quickly.
                Oil is a limited resource and we can and will run out of it during 
                the 21st century.

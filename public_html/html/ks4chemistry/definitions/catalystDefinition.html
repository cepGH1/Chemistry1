                <p>Something added to a reaction that helps the reaction work better, without
                being changed by the reaction</p>
                <p>A species that provides an alternative (lower energy) reaction path without being 
                modified by the reaction</p>
                <p>
                    Examples of catalysts include metals in catalytic converters of cars
                    and enzymes in your body.

                    Solid Phase Catalysis<br>
                    A solid (often a metal) provides a surface upon which a reaction
                    happens more easily and more smoothly

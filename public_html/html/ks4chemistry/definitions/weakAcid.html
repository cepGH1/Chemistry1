                <p> An acid that does not completely dissociate in aqueous solution.</p>
                <p> A weak acid produces less H<sup> + </sup> ions in solution than the same amount of a strong acid</p>
                <p>A weak acid's pH is not so low as a strong acid's pH</p>
                <p>Because these acids are less extreme in pH they are less likely to cause acid burns</p>
                <p><b>How does this happen?</b><br>
                If the acid has the formula HA<br>
                When it is dissolved or in liquid form, the following would happen;</p>
                
                <p>HA &#8652; H<sup> + </sup> + A<sup> - </sup></p>
                  
                <p>A <a id="definitions" onclick="definitionPopUp('../reversibleReactions.html')">reversible reaction</a> is taking place. Some of the HA splits
                apart to form ions (releasing hydrogen ions). Some remains as HA.</p>

                     ( CH<sub>3</sub>COOH )</p>
                <p> CH<sub>3</sub>COOH &#8652; CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup> - </sup> + H<sup> + </sup>

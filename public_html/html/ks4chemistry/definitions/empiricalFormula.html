                The simplest form of the formula of a compound. <br>
                <p>The formulae of salts are usually given in their empirical form. <br>
                This tells you how many metal ions there are compared to non-metal ions
                in the compound.<br>
                eg. sodium chloride  NaCl<br>
                One Chloride ion for every Sodium ion.<br>
                Magnesium Chloride MgCl<sub>2</sub><br>
                Two Chloride ions  for every one Magnesium ion</p>
                <p>
                    Covalently bonded molecules(such as organic molecules made with carbon
                    and hydrogen) are not normally described with their empirical formula.<br>
                    Their molecular formula is commonly used.<br>
                    Working out the empirical formula of a largish molecule is a common exam question
                </p>

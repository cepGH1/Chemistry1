                    If a substance contains a single chemical it is pure
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usually quoted as a percentage
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example. If a sample of a substance contains 99 molecules
                    of one chemical and 1 molecule of another chemical the substance
                    is 99/100 x 100 = 99% chemically pure.

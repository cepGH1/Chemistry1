                        The forwards rate of a reversible reaction is 25mol/s.
                        What is the value of the rate of reaction of the reverse reaction?</li>
                    <li>
                        Ammonia is produced during the reversible reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen<br>
                        2N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) &#8652; 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g)<br>
                        The enthalpy of reaction is -164KJ/mol<br>
                        Give two ways that the amount of ammonia could be maximised.

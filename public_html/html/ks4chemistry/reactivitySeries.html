                A list of metals(sometimes with carbon and hydrogen as well),  
                placed in order of how reactive they are. Those at the top are most 
                likely to take part in chemical reactions.
                Those at the bottom are least likely to undergo a chemical reaction.<br>
                The reactive metals at the top of this series are usually only seen in compounds.<br>

                <b>Displacement Reactions</b><br>
                A more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from it's salt in solution<br>
                <b>Example</b><br>
                Magnesium + Copper Sulphate &#8594; Magnesium Sulphate + Copper<br>
                Mg(s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) &#8594; MgSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + Cu(s)<br>
                <p>When a silver piece of Magnesium metal is dipped into a blue solution 
                of Copper Sulphate, the solution gradually becomes colourless and a brown
                deposit of Copper appears.</p>

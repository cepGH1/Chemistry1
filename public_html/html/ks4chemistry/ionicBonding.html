                <h3>How ions form</h3>
                <p>
                    Electrons are taken in by some atoms and given away by other atoms
                    so they become charged ions.<br>
                    Ions of opposite charge stick together.
                    (a bit like magnets)<br>
                    This is called electrostatic attraction. <br>
                    Atoms accept extra electrons until their outermost electron shell is full.<br>
                    Or, if it is easier, they give away electrons until their outer shell is empty.<br>
                    In general<br><ul> <li>metals give away their outer electrons to become positive ions</li>
                    <li> non-metals take in electrons to become negative ions</li></ul>

                <h3>Structure of Ionic Compounds</h3>
                In solid ionic compounds each ion is surrounded by ions of the opposite charge, in an endlessly
                repeated structure. A giant ionic lattice.
                <h4>How do we know this</h4>
                First of all scientists made educated guesses. They predicted how the ions 
                were arranged. Later X ray crystallography measured how the ions were arranged.
                Recently ions have been viewed through massively powerful electron microscopes.
                
                <h4>When ionic compounds dissolve</h4>
                Ions get surrounded by solvent molecules. They no longer stick to other ions
                and they are free to move.

                 By accepting an extra electron into its outer shell a -1 ion is produced and
                 the shell is full. This is a stable configuration. This is a hydride ion.
                 Hydride ions only exist under extreme conditions<br>

                Compounds have to be neutral (have no charge). The amount of negative charge
                in the compound must be equal to the amount of positive charge in the compound.<br>

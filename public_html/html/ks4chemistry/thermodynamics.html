                <h3>Thermodynamics</h3>
                <p>Thermodynamics is the study of how energy is moved about in chemical reactions.</p>
                <p>Chemical reactions do not make energy.</p>
                <p>Energy is absorbed or released by chemical reactions
                    as chemical bonds are broken or made.</p>
                <p>Bond breaking requires energy, which has to be taken in from the surroundings. (endothermic)</p>
                <p>Bond making releases energy, which is given out to the surroundings. (exothermic)</p>
                
            
            
                <p>The amount of energy taken in or given out depends on the type of
                    bond made or broken and upon which atoms are involved</p>
            
            
                <p>In a chemical reaction bonds are broken then made. For the whole
                reaction, energy is either given out or taken in depending on
                whether the bonds made give out more energy than the energy that the 
                bonds broken take in.</p>

                        This profile is an endothermic reaction. The products have more energy 
                        in them than the reactants. So, overall energy is taken in from
                        the surroundings when this reaction happens.<br>
                        The energy change is positive.<br>

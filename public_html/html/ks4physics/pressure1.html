                <h3>Example - the effect of pressure</h3>
                If a person stands on your foot it can be sore. Your foot will 
                be more sore if the person was wearing stilletto heels ( if its the heel on your foot)
                than if they are wearing flat shoes. This is because the stilletto heel has a very small area
                compared to the flat shoe heel. The same force (weight of the wearer) causes a lot 
                more pressure when the wearer has the stilletto heels on.<br>

                <h2>Gas Pressure</h2>
                If you squeeze the same amount of a gas into a smaller volume the pressure increases.<br>
                P x V = constant<br>
                If the volume is increased, but no extra gas added, the pressure is reduced<br>
                [This is only always true so long as the temperature stays the same]

                <h2>Pressure in liquids</h2>
                Pressure due to a column of liquid<br>
                P = height x mass x g / volume <br>
                This is an alternative way of writing force/area<br>

Chemistry is the science of the composition, structure, properties and reactions of matter, understood in terms of atoms, atomic particles and the way they are arranged and link together. It is concerned with the synthesis, formulation, analysis and characteristic properties of substances and materials of all kinds.

Students should be helped to appreciate the achievements of chemistry in showing how the complex and diverse phenomena of both the natural and man-made worlds can be described in terms of a number of key ideas which are of universal application, and which can be illustrated in the separate topics set out below. These ideas include:
<ul>
    <li> <a href="structureOfMatter1.html">matter is composed of tiny particles</a> called <a href="atomicStructure1.html">atoms</a> and <a href="periodicTable.html">there are about 100 different naturally-occurring types of atoms called elements</a></li>
    <li><a href="periodicTable.html">elements show <a href="groupChemistry1.html">periodic relationships in their chemical and physical properties</a></a></li>
    <li>these periodic properties can be explained in terms of the <a href="atomicStructure1.html">atomic structure</a> of the elements</li>
    <li>atoms bond either by transferring electrons from one atom to another or by sharing electrons</li>
    <li>the shapes of molecules (groups of atoms bonded together) and the way giant structures are arranged is of great importance in terms of the way they behave</li>
    <li>reactions can occur when molecules collide and do so at different rates due to differences in molecular collisions</li>
    <li>chemical reactions take place in only three different ways:<br>
        proton transfer<br>
        electron transfer<br>
        electron sharing</li>
    <li>energy is conserved in chemical reactions so can therefore be neither created nor destroyed</li>
</ul>
Students should be taught about:
Atomic structure and the Periodic Table

    a simple model of the atom consisting of the nucleus and electrons, relative atomic mass, electronic charge and isotopes
    the number of particles in a given mass of a substance
    the modern Periodic Table, showing elements arranged in order of atomic number
    position of elements in the Periodic Table in relation to their atomic structure and arrangement of outer electrons
    properties and trends in properties of elements in the same group
    characteristic properties of metals and non-metals
    chemical reactivity of elements in relation to their position in the Periodic Table

Structure, bonding and the properties of matter

    changes of state of matter in terms of particle kinetics, energy transfers and the relative strength of chemical bonds and intermolecular forces
    types of chemical bonding: ionic, covalent, and metallic
    bulk properties of materials related to bonding and intermolecular forces
    bonding of carbon leading to the vast array of natural and synthetic organic compounds that occur due to the ability of carbon to form families of similar compounds, chains and rings
    structures, bonding and properties of diamond, graphite, fullerenes and graphene

Chemical changes

    determination of empirical formulae from the ratio of atoms of different kinds
    balanced chemical equations, ionic equations and state symbols
    identification of common gases
    the chemistry of acids; reactions with some metals and carbonates
    pH as a measure of hydrogen ion concentration and its numerical scale
    electrolysis of molten ionic liquids and aqueous ionic solutions
    reduction and oxidation in terms of loss or gain of oxygen.

Energy changes in chemistry

    Measurement of energy changes in chemical reactions (qualitative)
    Bond breaking, bond making, activation energy and reaction profiles (qualitative)

Rate and extent of chemical change

    factors that influence the rate of reaction: varying temperature or concentration, changing the surface area of a solid reactant or by adding a catalyst
    factors affecting reversible reactions

Chemical analysis

    distinguishing between pure and impure substances
    separation techniques for mixtures of substances: filtration, crystallisation, chromatography, simple and fractional distillation
    quantitative interpretation of balanced equations
    concentrations of solutions in relation to mass of solute and volume of solvent

Chemical and allied industries

    life cycle assessment and recycling to assess environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product’s life
    the viability of recycling of certain materials
    carbon compounds, both as fuels and feedstock, and the competing demands for limited resources
    fractional distillation of crude oil and cracking to make more useful materials
    extraction and purification of metals related to the position of carbon in a reactivity series

Earth and atmospheric science

    evidence for composition and evolution of the Earth’s atmosphere since its formation
    evidence, and uncertainties in evidence, for additional anthropogenic causes of climate change
    potential effects of, and mitigation of, increased levels of carbon dioxide and methane on the Earth’s climate
    common atmospheric pollutants: sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulates and their sources
    the Earth’s water resources and obtaining potable water

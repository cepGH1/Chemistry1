        <div><h1>Carbon 13 NMR</h1>
            <p>One in every one hundred carbon atoms is of the Carbon 13 isotope
            This makes no difference to the chemical reactions it does, but doesmean
            it has odd spin and therefore gives an NMR spectrum.<br>
            Because it is only a tiny proportion of atoms, they are very unlikely 
            to be bonded and therefore there is no spin -spin coupling such as
            is seen in proton NMR</p>
            <p>Each differently bonded carbon produces its own peak in the NMR spectrum</p>
            <p>One peak per carbon environment, is another way of putting it</p>
            <p>Examples<br>
            C2H6 ethane, 2 carbons but they are bonded exactly the same. One carbon environment</p></div>

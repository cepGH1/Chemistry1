                    <li>
                        Early Earth had very many volcanoes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Radioactive decay of radioactive elements causes the heat that
                        keeps the rocks in the earths mantel molten. Even today this
                        is why there is magma and lava in volcanoes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The atmosphere formed from gases that were erupted from volcanoes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first atmosphere was mostly carbon dioxide, with water vapour
                        and small amounts of other gases. The first atmosphere had little or 
                        no oxygen in it
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
                <h3>How do we know this?</h3>
                Modern day volcanoes produce lots of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide
                but no oxygen. <br>
                The atmosphere of Mars is mostly carbon dioxide.
                <h3>Why did the atmosphere change to the mixture of gases we have today</h3>
                Early life forms began to 
                <a id="definitions" onclick="definitionPopUp('../ks4biology/photosynthesis.html')">photosynthesise</a>.<br>
                This process produced oxygen while using up carbon dioxide<br>
                Carbon dioxide also became dissolved in the newly formed oceans<br>

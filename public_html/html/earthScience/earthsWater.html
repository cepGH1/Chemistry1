                <h3>How did water arrive on planet Earth</h3>
                It is not definitely known, but it is thought that comets and asteroids
                bring water to our planet.<br> In the planet's early history there may have been
                collisions with comets and asteroids that contained lots of water.

            <div>
                The earth's oceans have been formed when water vapour condensed to water and 
                rained down, forming rivers that flowed under gravity to lowest areas of earth.
            </div>
            <div>
                Oceans are salty because rain water dissolves salts from the landscape and carries these
                salts to the sea.

                Water is constantly moving around our planet. The way water gets moved
                around the planet is described in the water cycle.

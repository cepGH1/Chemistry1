        <div><h1>Concentration</h1>
            How much of one thing there is in another thing<br>
            General example<br>
            If 100 pupils are in the school playground<br>
            That is 100pupils per playground as a type of concentration<br>
            why use concentration? <br>
            Because it can be applied to many playgrounds<br>
        If we said that this was the maximum concentration of pupils allowed.<br>
        Then a school of 200 pupils would need 2 playgrounds<br>

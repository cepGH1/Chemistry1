                Surprisingly a lot of new compounds are made by predicitng the product of 
                a reaction and then doing this 'new' reaction and making the predicted product.<br>
                Being able to predict the products of a reaction that you might not have seen before
                or don't remember is a perfectly valid way of doing chemistry<br>
